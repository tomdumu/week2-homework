<h1>Welcome.<h1>
<p> <p>
<p>Here are the rules:<p>
<p> <p>
<ul>
<li>Roll the dice to start the game.</li>
<li>If your first roll is a 7 or 11, you win.</li>
<li>If your first roll is a 2, 3 or 12, you lose.</li>
<li>
Anything else becomes your
<em>goal.</em>
Roll your goal again before rolling a 7, and you win.  Roll a 7 instead of your goal, and you lose.
